# Automation Scripts

These scripts are used to ease our everyday lives, in the following script I'm creating
a piece of code to check if a particular Service stored in `$ServiceName` variable is running and if it isn't we start it using `Start-Service` and check again.

If everything seems fine, we exit the script using `exit`.
